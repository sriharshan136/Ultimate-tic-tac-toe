# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is an advanced version of the traditional Tic Tac Toe game. It introduces strategic depth by embedding smaller Tic Tac Toe grids within a larger one. This web-based game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Nested Grids**: Play on a 3x3 grid where each cell contains a smaller 3x3 grid.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes using CSS.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Includes real-time feedback for valid moves and win conditions.
- **Customizable Rules**: Easily adaptable game logic.

## How to Play

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Each cell of the main grid corresponds to a smaller Tic Tac Toe grid.
   - A move in a small grid sends the next player to the corresponding grid.
   - Win three small grids in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.
2. **Winning Conditions**:
   - Win a small grid by aligning three marks in a row.
   - Dominate the large grid by controlling three small grids in a row.
